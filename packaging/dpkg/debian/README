# The Ice Framework

Ice helps you build networked applications with minimal effort. By taking care of all interactions with low-level
network programming interfaces, Ice allows you to focus your efforts on your application logic. You don't need to
worry about details such as opening network connections, encoding and decoding data for network transmission, or
retrying failed connection attempts (to name just a few of dozens of such low-level details).
