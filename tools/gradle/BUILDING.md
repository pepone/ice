# Building Ice Slice Tools Gradle Plugin

This document describes how to build and publish the Ice Slice Tools Gradle Plugin.

## Prerequisites

- JDK 17 or greater

## Build

The plugin can be built using the following Gradle command:

```shell
./gradlew build
```

This will:

- Compile the source code
- Run tests
- Package the plugin

### Bundled Compiler and Ice Slice Files

To ensure that the Slice-to-Java compiler (slice2java) and the Ice Slice files are included with the plugin and
available at runtime, they must be copied to the pluginâ€™s resources directory.

The plugin expects the following structure within src/main/resources/:

```shell
src/main/resources/slice         # Ice Slice files
src/main/resources/macos-arm64   # slice2java compiler for macOS (Apple Silicon)
src/main/resources/linux-arm64   # slice2java compiler for Linux (ARM64)
src/main/resources/linux-x64     # slice2java compiler for Linux (x86_64)
src/main/resources/windows-x64   # slice2java compiler for Windows (x86_64)
```

## Publish

The plugin can be published to **Maven Local** for testing or to a **remote repository** for distribution.

### Publish to Maven Local (For Development)

To publish the plugin to your local Maven repository (`~/.m2/repository`), run:

```shell
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

This allows other projects on your machine to use the locally published version.

### Publish to a Remote Repository (Maven Central, Artifactory, etc.)

To publish the plugin to a remote repository, ensure your **Gradle properties** (`~/.gradle/gradle.properties`) contain the necessary credentials:

```shell
mavenRepository=repository-url
mavenUsername=your-username
mavenPassword=your-password
```

Then, publish the plugin using:

```shell
./gradlew publish
```

### Publish to the Gradle Plugin Portal

To publish the plugin to the **Gradle Plugin Portal**, follow these steps:

- Add the following to your `gradle.properties`:

```shell
gradle.publish.key=your-key
gradle.publish.secret=your-secret
```

- Run the following command to publish:

```shell
./gradlew publishPlugins
```
