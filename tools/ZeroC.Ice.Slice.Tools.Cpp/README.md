# Slice Tools for Ice C++

ZeroC.Ice.Slice.Tools.Cpp allows you to compile Slice definitions (in `.ice` files) into C++ code (in `.cpp` files)
within MSBuild projects.

This package includes the Slice compiler for C++, `slice2cpp`. This compiler is a native tool with binaries for
Windows (x64).

Once you've added the ZeroC.Ice.Slice.Tools.Cpp NuGet package to your project, the Slice files of your project are
automatically compiled into C++ files every time you build this project.

> The Slice MSBuild task checks the dependencies of the Slice files it compiles and only rebuilds the Slice files that,
> are not up to date.
