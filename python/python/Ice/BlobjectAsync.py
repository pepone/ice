class BlobjectAsync(Object, ABC):
    """
    Special-purpose servant base class that allows a subclass to handle asynchronous Ice invocations as "blobs" of
    bytes.

    This class serves as a base for creating servants that can process encoded Ice operation arguments and return
    results or exceptions in an encoded form asynchronously. Subclasses must implement the `ice_invoke` method to
    handle the invocation logic.

    @abstractmethod
    def ice_invoke(self, bytes, current):
        """
        Dispatches an asynchronous Ice invocation.

        The operation's arguments are encoded in the `bytes` parameter. The result must be a tuple of two values:
        the first is a boolean indicating whether the operation succeeded (True) or raised a user exception (False),
        and the second is the encoded form of the operation's results or the user exception. The subclass can either
        return the tuple directly (for synchronous completion) or return a future that is eventually completed with
        the tuple.

        Parameters
        ----------
        bytes : bytes
            The encoded operation arguments.
        current : Ice.Current
            The current invocation context.

        Returns
        -------
        tuple of (bool, bytes) or Future
            A tuple containing:
            - bool
                True if the operation succeeded, False if it raised a user exception.
            - bytes
                The encoded form of the operation's results or the user exception.

            Or a Future that is eventually completed with the above tuple.
